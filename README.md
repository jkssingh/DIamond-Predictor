# Diamond Predictor
The Diamond Predictor that uses the Machine Learning to predict the diamond prices. Its is based on the supervised learning that implements number of regressors that are trained on the data. I dont own this data. This dataset is openly available at kaggle. 

A very basic GUI is also designed to ease the process of prediction and visualization. 
The GUI is designed using the Tkinter library in Python.

To run this just download all the files and copy all the files to a folder and run the 
"Diamond_final_gui.py" and you will get the GUI designed 

Some drawbacks:-
1. Opening two graphs at same time may overwrite each other.
2. Different windows will open for each graph.
